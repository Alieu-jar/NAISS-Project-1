# NAISS-Project-1
# Project Description:

You are given a corrupted dataset on who survived the Titanic (most likely fictional).

## Part 1

The main task is to preprocess the dataset so that they only have relevant features and clean values. The data will be corrupted such that it'll have: 

- missing values
- duplicate values
- incorrect types 
- incompatible types

It is your task to make sure the data is preprocessed well to train your classification algorothim on. 

## Part 2 

Please choose any classificaiton algorithm to train the preprocessed data on, it is totally up to you. The main goal here is to practice training and fitting the model to the preprocessed data. We will be checking for that more than the accuracy of the model itself.

# Instructions to clone the repository

Once you have accepted the assignment, you will have a forked repository from the template with your specific username. 

You can clone the repository locally by doing:

`git clone [link to your specific repo]`

For example, a github repository with the username "psuTEST" will be running the following command: 

`git clone https://github.com/NAISS-Spring-2025-MLB/project-1-data-preprocessing-and-whitebox-model-training-psuTEST`

You can then work on this either in Google Colab, Jupyter Notebook, or any other IDE or text editor. The file is in ipynb for simplicity, but feel free to use a python file if that is easier for you. 

The data preprocessing slides are also posted on our tech team repo which you can find at this link: https://github.com/JPM2002/Tech-Team---Nittany-Ai

You can use the slides to review and refresh on all the data preprocessing tasks that we talked about. 

# Submission

We will be grading the project on the following criteria:

- You have printed out a pre-processed dataframe
- You trained a fit a classification algorithm on the preprocessed data

To submit the project, simply run the following command in the directory where you cloned the GitHub repo:

`git push origin main`

Afterwards, please fill out this form with your GitHub username and your latest commit ID: https://forms.gle/um7UiHirq2XRdjoMA 

The project will be due on **Wednesday, February 5th**! As always, feel free to reach out with any questions
